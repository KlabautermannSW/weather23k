    brief       Handle access to a WS2300 compatible weather station.

    details     This driver provides low level access functions to a WS2300
                compatible weather station.
                The API includes
                - ws_init
                - ws_open
                - ws_close
                - ws_read
                - ws_write

    project     weather23k
    target      Linux
    begin       14.04.2017

    note        The functionality is based on the work done by Kenneth Larvsen
                (openWS23) but has advanced driver capabilities to prevent
                WS2300 hardware dependent problems when using the serial interface.
