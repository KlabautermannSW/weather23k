    brief           Reset WS2300 weather station by sending command 0x06.

                    Occasionally 0, then 2 is returned. If zero comes back, continue
                    reading as this is more efficient than sending an out-of sync
                    reset and letting the data reads restore synchronization.
                    Occasionally, multiple 2's are returned. Read with a fast timeout
                    until all data is exhausted, if we got a two back at all, we
                    consider it a success.
